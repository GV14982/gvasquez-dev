# About Me

![Me and my cat, Fritzy](/photo.webp)

## Hello world! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer from Philadelphia (**Go birds** ðŸ¦…) with a love of building things that make people's lives _easier_. I've primarly worked in the web world, from crafting CSS to managing deployments in kubernetes. I definitely lean towards the backend, but I like to be flexible and help where it's needed.

In my free time I enjoy boardgames (My current favorite is the <a href="https://contentiongames.com/games/slay/" target="_blank">Slay the Spire Boardgame</a>) and playing my guitar. I also have a love of mechanical keyboards (Linear switches are where it's at)

The picture is of me and my cat Fritzy. He followed me home and is the sweetest little man I know.
