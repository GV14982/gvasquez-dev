        I'm a self taught (well mostly self taught) web developer from Easton
        PA. I mostly focus on the MERN stack, but I'm also proficient with PHP
        (in the form of Laravel and Wordpress).

        I am also comfortable with Python, Ruby, Bash, git, docker, and SQL
        databases. I have a background in IT and computer repair, which adds to
        my skill sets when it comes to the underlying technology that supports
        the software I build.
