## Hello world! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software engineer from **Philadelphia** (Go birds ðŸ¦…) with a love of building things that make people's lives _easier_. I've primarly worked in the web world, from crafting CSS to managing deployments in kubernetes. I definitely lean towards the backend, but I like to be flexible and help where it's needed.
