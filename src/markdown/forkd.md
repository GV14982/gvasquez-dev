# Forkd
Forkd is a collaborative recipe application that aims to be “Github for cooking”. All recipes are made up of one or more revisions. Users can “fork” another recipe at a particular revision, which will save a copy to their account. That allows them to start creating new revisions but still retain the backlink to the “forked” recipe.
